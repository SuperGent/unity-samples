# Parsers


## Config File Parser
The objective of the config file parser is that it can be inherited from by any class and its functions can be used. The constructor takes in a file path and a new Config file can be generated from the config file at this path. A similar function is provided with the save method. It takes in a file path, and it will write all of the data about the object to the file path in the config format.
